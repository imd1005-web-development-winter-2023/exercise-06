# Exercise 05 - HTML

Welcome to exercise 05 - let's build a whole page.

## Steps

1. Create a folder on your local machine to work in and open it up in VSCode
2. Create an HTML page in your local working folder (you can call `index.html` or any name you want)
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created HTML file
4. Using your knowledge of HTML semantic elements, contact tags, and forms, build a page for the Construction company that is building a new apartment building.
5. Add appropriate `id` and `for` and `name` attributes to the form elements
6. Add a `<button>` element that is of type submit and has the button text "Request information"
7. Use the screen capture / image below to help you with the form. Your page should look something close to it at the end of the exercise
8. **Bonus 1:** Add `autocomplete` attributes to the name and email inputs
9. **Bonus 2:** Make the name and email fields required by both adding the text "required" and also adding the `required` attribute
10. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solution` folder for one way of putting this together

## Final Solution

Note: depending on what browser you are using your form elements may look slightly different
